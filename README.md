>[Brief description - what is the project and value does it provide? How often should users expect to get releases? How is versioning set up? Where does this project want to go?]

## Installation

To install the solution you need to install nodejs first. Required minimum version of nodejs is 12.x.
When you have the nodejs run command `npm install` to setup the project.

## Getting Started
To run the software you need to have installed serverless framework to run it locally or have got valid AWS account to deploy it into cloud.

To run locally the solution use command `sls offline`.

Better way is to deploy the solution into AWS cloud. Lambdas are free for 2 milion requests. To deploy solution into AWS cloud you need created AWS IAM account and setup credentials locally. To do this check the link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html

After setting up the AWS credentials the user can use command `sls deploy` to deploy the lambdas to AWS cloud. 

WARNING!
If you have multiple AWS configs you should use command `sls deploy --aws-profile <profile-name>`
